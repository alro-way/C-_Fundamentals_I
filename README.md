Assignment: Fundamentals I.

1) Create a Loop that prints all values from 1-255
2) Create a new loop that prints all values from 1-100 that are divisible by 3 or 5, but not both
3) Modify the previous loop to print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5
4) (Optional) If you used "for" loops for your solution, try doing the same with "while" loops. Vice-versa if you used "while" loops!
